# SplitOperator

## About

A 1D, 2D and 3D implementation of the split operator algorithm for a particle in a harmonic potential. 

## Physical background

Will be added whenever I am motivated to do so.

## Build
This project uses [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) so make sure your system can find the needed header files.
